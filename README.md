This repository provides the official implementation of a free pupillometry platform called PupilEXT proposed in the article *"PupilEXT: flexible open-source platform for high resolution pupil measurement in vision research"* authored by [Babak Zandi](https://www.lichttechnik.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_lichttechnik_lt/team_lt/mitarbeiter_lt_detail_65600.en.jsp), Moritz Lode, Alexander Herzog, Georgios Sakas and [Tran Quoc Khanh](https://www.lichttechnik.tu-darmstadt.de/fachgebiet_lichttechnik_lt/team_lt/mitarbeiter_lt_detail_34952.en.jsp) from the Technical University of Darmstadt.<br/>

We submitted our work to Frontiers in Neuroscience. The pupillometry software with a detailed introduction will soon be available here.

## Overview and installation
Coming soon.
